# Simple Neural Network Implementation in Python

This repository contains a simple Python implementation of a feedforward neural network. The neural network is trained using a basic gradient descent algorithm to learn binary classification.

## Overview

The neural network in this code consists of three neurons:

1. **Neuron 0 and Neuron 1:** These neurons have a hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation function.
2. **Neuron 2:** This neuron uses the logistic sigmoid activation function.

### Requirements

    Python 3.x
    NumPy library
